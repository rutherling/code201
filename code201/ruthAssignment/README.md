Code 201
Lab 4, 5/12/16
Pair programming: Michelle S and Ruth
Ruth's quick bio and a 5 question quiz.

Michelle did:
-move game to its own HTML and create a link from index.HTML
-move each question logic into its own function, commit after each question.
-moved all the questions, answers, and auto responses into an array.
-added a section to call all the functions.

Ruth did:
-modify each function to point to correct position in an array
-changed all the alert()s to textContent changes in game.HTML
-added a link from game.html back to index.HTML
-fixed array (with help from Max and Alex, thanks)
-fixed while loop on question 5
-moved relevant variables so they are declared before the functions run
-changed verbiage and took out special symbols
-added scrollTo so user can see quiz results
