Thursday!
"As a [who], I want [what], so that [why]".

Wednesday!
As a user, I want to see consistent app behavior. When I click on a button, I should know what that button does before I click it, and it should always do the same thing.

As a user, I want the app to hold onto my vote history so I can come back to the page later. Ex: if my Great Suspender google plugin forces the page to refresh, I do not want to start over.

As a developer, I do not want to re-write sections of the code to account for repeating logic. I should be able to refer to a function, then call the function whenever I need to based on the user's flow.

Tuesday!
As a product developer, I want to see the percentages (#clicks / # shown) as labels.

As a user, I want to visualize the proportion of #clicks to #shown so I can intuit the popularity of each product.

As a product developer, I want a clear stop after a certain count of votes so the user has an imposed limit.

As a product developer, I want the user to have an option to start a new round of 16 votes so they are not completely limited.

As a user I want the visualization to be easy on the eye and have intriguing colors.

Monday!

As a product developer, I want to know the relative popularity (#clicks / #shows) of an image so that I can clearly compare images.

As an app developer, I want clearly named variables and functions so it will be easy to debug and collaborate (with my team or future self).

As a tester, I want a clear set of expected outcomes to verify the app works as designed.

As a voter (end user), I want three distinct options each round so I have a diverse set of candidates and unbiased results.

As a voter, I want to see the results of the poll so I can know if I should keep voting (until my choice is the most popular one).
