Monday!

As a product developer, I want to know the relative popularity (#clicks / #shows) of an image so that I can clearly compare images.

As an app developer, I want clearly named variables and functions so it will be easy to debug and collaborate (with my team or future self).

As a tester, I want a clear set of expected outcomes to verify the app works as designed.

As a voter (end user), I want three distinct options each round so I have a diverse set of candidates and unbiased results.

As a voter, I want to see the results of the poll so I can know if I should keep voting (until my choice is the most popular one).


Tuesday!
