Dedicated to Barack Obama.

This is an app that shows the user three images so they can vote by clicking. The clicks eventually build up to show the popularity of an image.

Monday
-Overall, how did this lab go?
-How much time did it take you?
-What did you learn? What are your lingering questions?
I learned that CSS uses colons as the assignment operator, NOT equal signs.
I would not have intuited to put the imgNames in an array, like we did in mob coding. I didn't know that divs had a style property (.style) so that I could change the background image with JavaScript. I'm still not sure about .map but the example in mob coding helps a lot!
I figured out what an event target is!

Lingering questions: What is really supposed to go in a README.md?
I need a little refresher on appendChild. I thought mine was ok!
